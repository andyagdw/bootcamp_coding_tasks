# Software Engineering Bootcamp Tasks 🎆

Hello👋, welcome to my repository where I've compiled some of the Python tasks that I completed during my software engineering
bootcamp journey at HyperionDev and CoGrammar. Each task demonstrates my learning progress and showcases various skills that
I've acquired. Feel free to explore them 😄.

## Tasks 💥

1. Email Simulator: <br>
   Implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, this program allows users to manage their emails by creating,
   viewing, marking as read, marking as spam, moving to the bin, and deleting emails. The program organises emails into folders
   (i.e., inbox, spam, and bin) and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with these emails.

2. Minesweeper Program: <br>
   It takes a grid of mines represented by '#' and mine-free spots represented by '-' and returns a grid where each mine-free spot is
   replaced by a digit indicating the number of adjacent mines (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
   
3. Task Manager Application: <br>
   Employing the 'Model-View-Controller' pattern, this program facilitates users to effortlessly create, update, remove, or view tasks,
   deadlines, priorities, and categories. Please note that tasks do not get saved to a database - see my
   [task_manager_app](https://github.com/andyagdw/task_manager_app) repository.
