# Software Engineering Bootcamp Projects üéÜ

Helloüëã, welcome to my repository where I've compiled some of the Python projects I completed during my software engineering
bootcamp journey at HyperionDev and CoGrammar. Each project demonstrates my learning progress and showcases various skills
I've acquired. Feel free to explore them üòÑ.

## Projects

1) Email Simulator <br />
   Implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, this program allows users to manage their emails by creating,
   viewing, marking as read, marking as spam, moving to the bin, and deleting emails. The program organises emails into folders
   (i.e., inbox, spam, and bin) and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with these emails.

   Learning OOP is vital for modular, maintainable, and scalable software development. It promotes code organisation, abstraction
   of complex systems, data security through encapsulation, code reuse via inheritance, and flexibility with polymorphism, enhancing
   readability and facilitating collaboration in large projects.

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/andyagdw/bootcamp_coding_tasks.git</code>

2) Navigate to the project directory:<br />
<code>cd bootcamp_coding_tasks</code>

3) Open Visual Studio Code:
   <code>Code .</code>
