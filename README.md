# Software Engineering Bootcamp Projects üéÜ

Helloüëã, welcome to my repository where I've compiled some of the Python projects I completed during my software engineering
bootcamp journey at HyperionDev and CoGrammar. Each project demonstrates my learning progress and showcases various skills that
I've acquired. Feel free to explore them üòÑ.

## Projects

1) Email Simulator <br />
   Implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, this program allows users to manage their emails by creating,
   viewing, marking as read, marking as spam, moving to the bin, and deleting emails. The program organises emails into folders
   (i.e., inbox, spam, and bin) and provides a user-friendly interface to interact with these emails.

   Learning OOP is vital for modular, maintainable, and scalable software development. It promotes code organisation, abstraction
   of complex systems, data security through encapsulation, code reuse via inheritance, and flexibility with polymorphism, enhancing
   readability and facilitating collaboration in large projects.

3) Minesweeper Program <br />
   It takes a grid of mines represented by # and mine-free spots represented by - and returns a grid where each mine-free spot is
   replaced by a digit indicating the number of adjacent mines (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally).
   
   Learning about data structures is crucial because they provide efficient ways to organise and manipulate data in a program.
   Understanding data structures allows for optimised storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, leading to more efficient
   and scalable code. It helps in solving complex problems and designing robust algorithms.

## Getting Started

1) Clone the repository to your local machine:<br />
<code>git clone https://github.com/andyagdw/bootcamp_coding_tasks.git</code>

2) Navigate to the project directory:<br />
<code>cd bootcamp_coding_tasks</code>

3) Open Visual Studio Code:
   <code>Code .</code>
